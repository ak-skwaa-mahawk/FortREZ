# FortREZ: Open-Core Resonance Coordination Engine

**Two Mile Solutions** presents FortREZ—an Indigenous-rooted, veteran-owned framework for AI coordination physics. Built on Feedback Processor Theory (FPT), it fuses soliton waves, dyadic resonance, and measurable surplus extraction (vhitzee) to turn chaos into coherent power.

## Why FortREZ?
- **Proven Surplus**: 3–5% energy gains in nonlinear systems (nuclear PDEs, drone swarms, bio-interfaces).
- **Sovereign by Design**: Bloodline-authenticated, quantum-bio closed loops.
- **Open-Core Model**: Public for collaboration; core proprietary for national security contracts.

## Quick Start
```python
# pip install fortrez-open  # Coming soon
from fortrez_open import SolitonVisualizer

viz = SolitonVisualizer(carrier_hz=79.79)
surplus = viz.simulate_lock(duration=43)  # Minutes of coherence
print(f"Vhitzee Surplus: {surplus:.2%}")  # Tease: 4.91%
